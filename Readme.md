# Functional Programming in Scala
This is a series of excercises that I develop to learn functional programming using the Scala programming language following the *Advanced Scala and Functional Programming* course in Udemy.

Scala is a programming language with a very flexible syntax that allows the use of a different ways of sugar syntax. There are 6 examples of this in [SugarSyntax.scala](/src/main/scala/SugarSyntax.scala).

1. Methods with single parameter: The parameter can be provided inside the parenthesis or as an expression.
2. Single Abstract Method: Classes or Traits with a single abstract method can be implemented as a lambda
3. The :: and #:: methods are special: methods that en in colon (:) are right-associative (evaluated the right-side of the expression first).
4. Multi-word method naming
5. Infix types
6. The update() method: Is special, much like apply()
